The purpose of the crew pairing problem is to generate a set of pairings with minimal cost, covering all flight legs that the company has to carry out during a predefined time period. The proposed solution is a two-phase procedure. For the first phase, the pairing generation, a depth first search approach is employed. The second phase deals with the selection of a subset of the generated pairings with near optimal cost. This problem, which is modelled by a set covering formulation, is solved with a genetic algorithm. The presented method was tested on actual flight data of Olympic Airways.},

We propose a new Row Weighting Local Search (RWLS) algorithm for solving the unicost variant of the SCP, i.e., USCPs where the costs of all sets are identical. RWLS is a heuristic algorithm that has three major components united in its local search framework: (1) a weighting scheme, which updates the weights of uncovered elements to prevent convergence to local optima, (2) tabu strategies to avoid possible cycles during the search, and (3) a timestamp method to break ties when prioritizing sets. RWLS has been evaluated on a large number of problem instances from the OR-Library and compared with other approaches. It is able to find all the best known solutions (BKS) and improve 14 of them, although requiring a higher computational effort on several instances. RWLS is especially effective on the combinatorial OR-Library instances and can improve the best known solution to the hardest instance CYC11 considerably. RWLS is conceptually simple and has no instance-dependent parameters, which makes it a practical and easy-to-use USCP solver.},

A fitness function is proposed for this problem and different neighborhood relations are considered for the exploration of the neighborhood of the current solution. A new approach is introduced for effective exploration of the neighborhood during the improvement phase. This approach is based on the upper bound of the best cover, which is found during the search, and using only determined moves. Additionally, in order to avoid cycles during the search, a search history is used. The proposed algorithm is experimentally evaluated for 85 well-known random and combinatorial problems in the literature, and it gives very satisfactory results in a reasonable amount of time. The proposed algorithm improves the best existing solutions for 8 problems in the literature. For a class of combinatorial problems, the best existing results are improved significantly.},

The genetic algorithm itself provides this decoder with permutations of the solution variables and other parameters. Second, it will be shown that results can be further improved by adding another indirect optimisation layer. The decoder will not directly seek out low cost solutions but instead aims for good exploitable solutions. These are then post-optimised by another hill-climbing algorithm. Although seemingly more complicated, we will show that this three-stage approach has advantages in terms of solution quality, speed and adaptability to new types of problems over more direct approaches. Extensive computational results are presented and compared to the latest evolutionary and other heuristic approaches to the same data instances.},

In addition to some random aspects, used in the construction and local search phases, we also apply mutation in order to further escape from local optima. The proposed algorithm has been tested over 80 instances of the literature. On the classical benchmark instances, where the number of columns is larger than the number of rows, the algorithm, by using a fixed set of parameters, always found the best known solution, and for 12 instances it was able to improve the current best solution. By using different parameter settings the algorithm improved 4 additional best known solutions.

The worse results obtained by the genetic algorithm show the impact of the electromagnetism metaheuristic approach in conducting the search of the solution space by applying the movements based on the electromagnetism theory.

  abstract  = {{Graph vertex coloring with a given number of colors is a well-known and much-studied NP-complete problem. The most effective methods to solve this problem are proved to be hybrid algorithms such as memetic algorithms or quantum annealing. Those hybrid algorithms use a powerful local search inside a population-based algorithm. This paper presents a new memetic algorithm based on one of the most effective algorithms: the hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) from Galinier and Hao (J Comb Optim 3(4): 379{\textendash}397, 1999). The proposed algorithm, denoted HEAD{\ifmmode---\else\textemdash\fi}for HEA in Duet{\ifmmode---\else\textemdash\fi}works with a population of only two individuals. Moreover, a new way of managing diversity is brought by HEAD. These two main differences greatly improve the results, both in terms of solution quality and computational time. HEAD has produced several good results for the popular DIMACS benchmark graphs, such as 222-colorings for {$\lbrace$}{$\rbrace$}, 81-colorings for {$\lbrace$}{$\rbrace$} and even 47-colorings for {$\lbrace$}{$\rbrace$} and 82-colorings for {$\lbrace$}{$\rbrace$}.}},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the role of dual information on the performances of heuristics designed for solving the set covering problem. After solving the linear programming relaxation of the problem, the dual information is used to obtain the two main approaches proposed here: (i) The size of the original problem is reduced and then the resulting model is solved with exact methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on a rich set of benchmark instances compiled from the literature. We conclude that set covering problems of various characteristics and sizes may reliably be solved to near optimality without resorting to custom solution methods. (ii) The dual information is embedded into an existing heuristic. This approach is demonstrated on a well-known local search based heuristic that was reported to obtain successful results on the set covering problem. Our results demonstrate that the use of dual information significantly improves the efficacy of the heuristic in terms of both solution time and accuracy.},

The algorithm uses a set of heuristics to find prime covers, another set of heuristics to find feasible solutions to the dual linear program which are needed to generate cuts, and subgradient optimization to find lower bounds. It also uses implicit enumeration with some new branching rules. Each of the ingredients was implemented and tested in several versions. The variant of the algorithm that emerged as best was run on 55 randomly generated test problems (20 of them from the literature), with up to 200 constraints and 2000 variables. The results show the algorithm to be more reliable and efficient than earlier procedures on large, sparse set covering problems.},
